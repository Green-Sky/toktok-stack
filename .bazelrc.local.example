# Copy this file to .bazelrc.local and adjust to meet your needs.

# Note that bazel will still only run as many jobs as it can on your number of
# CPU cores. The number 16 here just means it will look ahead and schedule more
# jobs to make sure all cores are always busy. If you have more than 16 cores,
# you'll want to change this number to at least `$(($(nproc) + 4))`.
build --jobs=16

# You may set one of "gcc" or "clang" (unless you are on Windows) to enable
# additional warning flags specific to these compilers.
build --config=clang
#build --config=gcc

# You may choose one of the possible sandboxing technologies.
#build --config=sandboxfs
#build --config=docker-sandbox

# You may use the remote cache. This is mostly only useful when building with
# docker-sandbox, as that way you'll be sharing build artifacts with the CI
# builds, speeding up your builds significantly.
#build --config=remote
#build --config=remote-exec

# Optionally enable *one* of the following configs. If none is enabled, we build
# in fastbuild mode (no optimisation, minimal debugging information).
#build --config=debug
#build --config=release

# Use this config to put tox into a test network that speaks an incompatible
# protocol (all packet ids are shifted).
#build --config=testnet
